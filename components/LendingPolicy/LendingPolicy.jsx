          <b>Lenders</b>
          <p>
            PoorCreditQuickLoans.com has lenders and lending partners of all
            types in our network and in the other third-party lender networks in
            our extended network. If you receive a loan offer, we strongly
            suggest that you look up the details on the lender so that you are
            aware of how to get in touch with them in case you have any concerns
            or questions. A potential lender or lending partner has their own
            terms and conditions regarding loan interest rates; the requirements
            for repayment; and the repercussions of being late on, missing or
            rolling over a payment. You should make sure you are aware of your
            lender or lending partner’s specific loan terms and conditions. You
            are encouraged to shop around and ensure that you are comfortable
            with the terms provided. If no lenders offer you a loan, you may be
            presented offers for debt relief, credit repair, credit monitoring
            or other related services. We may share limited contact information
            with a limited number of these other providers so they can offer
            their services to you. But don’t worry, we don’t share any of the
            sensitive information in your loan request with them. Carefully
            review these offers and compare them to all other options available
            to you before accepting. If you are not interested in the products
            or services offered, you should ignore the offer.

          <p>
            All lenders and lending partners in our network are required to
            comply with applicable federal, state and local laws. One of these
            laws is the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which requires
            lenders and lending partners to provide you with the exact fees,
            interest rate and other information about your loan. This should be
            presented to you prior to you executing any loan agreement with the
            lender. You should keep an eye out for this disclosure and pay
            particular attention to it.

          <b>Your Credit Score</b>
          <p>
            One of the first and most important things to understand as a
            borrower is that being late on a payment, missing a payment or
            rolling over a payment may negatively impact your credit score. Your
            credit score is a numerical expression of your credit worthiness
            based on an analysis of your credit files. A credit score is
            primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from
            credit bureaus. Failing to pay on time may negatively affect this
            score and make it harder for you to do things like take out a credit
            card or get a loan. While less than perfect credit will not
            necessarily prevent you from being able to receive a loan, all loans
            are subject to credit approval. As such, the lender or lending
            partner that you are connected with may run a credit check with one
            or more credit agency. If you have had many credit checks in a given
            period of time, it is possible that this check may negatively affect
            your credit score. But, if you are able to make all of your payments
            on time, the process of taking out and repaying a loan may improve
            your credit score.
          </p>
          <br />
          <b>Late Payments</b>
          <p>
            As a borrower you need to understand the effect of making late
            payments on your loan. Although each lender has their own terms and
            conditions for the loans they offer and the repayment of such, there
            are some general late-payment repercussions that you should
            understand. First, there will likely be charges assessed if you make
            a late payment. Furthermore, if you extend a loan, the finance
            charge for the original loan needs to be paid on the original due
            date. Then your loan principal amount will be deferred with an extra
            finance charge. We advise that you pay as much as possible toward
            your original due date in order to further reduce the charges that
            you incur. Should you intend to deviate from your payment plan, make
            sure that you contact your lender or lending partner immediately to
            establish a new payment arrangement. If your loan payment is
            rejected for any reason by your banking institution, the lender or
            lending partner may initiate collection procedures and you will not
            be able to receive future loans from the lender or lending partner
            until all of your payment obligations are fully met. It is important
            to remember to read about the penalties and payment options for the
            specific lender or lending partner that you are connected with and
            to make sure that you completely understand their policies. Finally,
            keep in mind that personal loans are intended only to be used for
            short-term financial needs; they are not meant to be a long-term
            financial solution. In general you should always make sure to pay
            all of your outstanding loans/bills/debts in a timely fashion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <b>Missing a Payment</b>
          <p>
            PoorCreditQuickLoans.com recommends that you pay all of your
            outstanding loans/bills/debts when they are due and no later. By
            paying everything in a timely fashion, you will ensure that you have
            a positive payment record and will minimize negative repercussions.
            Each lender has their own terms and conditions regarding the
            specific implications of missing a payment with them. However, if a
            lender doesn’t receive a payment the likely result is that they will
            file collection procedures against you and you won’t be able to
            receive any more loans from the lender. Therefore, it is crucial for
            you to both understand the specific requirements when it comes to
            repayment and the repercussions of missing a payment. And again, we
            strongly urge you to pay all outstanding loans/bills/debts when
            they’re due.
          </p>
          <br />
          <b>Rolling Over a Payment</b>
          <p>
            With some lenders, it may be possible to roll over payments if you
            find that you can’t make a scheduled payment date. However, please
            note that, as is the case with missing a payment or being late on a
            payment, rolling over a payment will negatively impact your credit
            score. Also, please understand that the interest you pay will be the
            same with the rolled-over payment as it is with the missed payment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <b>Types of Renewal Policies</b>
          <p>
            PoorCreditQuickLoans.com has a number of different types of lenders
            in our network and in the other third-party lender networks in our
            extended network. Each of these lenders has its own individual
            renewal policy. As a general rule, however, there are two different
            kinds of renewals, and they are as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Unlimited renewals — These enable you to continuously renew and
              are the most risky for loan borrowers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic and borrower-initiated renewals — These renewal types
              are not unlimited and are subject to specified time limits.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It is important to understand that once a loan is no longer able to
            be renewed by a borrower, the lender or lending partner will have to
            begin a collection process to recoup the amount owed. Each lender or
            lending partner will have their own specific policy with regard to
            this, so it is important that you carefully read and understand your
            lender or lending partner’s policy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <b>Collection</b>
          <p>
            In general, lenders will take payment directly from your bank
            account when it is due. However, each lender has its own terms and
            conditions, and you should make sure you understand these for your
            individual lender before you accept any loan offer. If you miss a
            payment on your loan and do not contact your lender to arrange other
            repayment options, your loan will likely be subject to collection.
            You will usually be contacted via telephone, email and regular mail.
            If you continue to not respond, the lender will most likely use an
            outside collection agency to collect the debt. These specifics will
            differ from one lender to another, so it’s important that you be
            sure to read and understand your particular lender’s disclosures and
            terms and conditions. Also, remember that it’s always in your best
            interest to pay back your loan on time whenever possible. All
            lenders and debt collectors are required by law to comply with the
            Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. All lenders are required by law
            to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.
