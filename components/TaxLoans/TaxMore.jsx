                Wondering how to qualify for a tax advance yourself? You’ll be
                eligible if you expect to receive a refund from the IRS in the
                year you want the income loan. You may be required to borrow a
                minimum amount, such as $100-$500.

                Once you’ve requested a tax advance loan, you might get your
                funds as soon as the next business day after your request is
                processed. This is an appealing turnaround time for many people
                since it can often take 21 days or more for the IRS to issue tax
                returns.

              Does It Cost Money to Get a Tax Advance?

                The cost of getting a tax advance depends on the lender and the
                person paying the loan. Some lenders will give you the loan
                without charging any fees or interest, but they may charge you
                to process the loan. Other lenders might offer the tax advance
                as an incentive for filing your taxes with their company. This
                money can be paid out of pocket or be taken as a cut from your
                tax refund totals. The tax refund loan will also cost you money
                if you don’t pay the loan back on time or are charged an
                interest rate. Carefully consider the terms of the loan to know
                what the tax advance may cost you over time.

              How Does a Tax Refund Loan Affect Your Credit Score?

              <p className="leading-7 pt-2 pb-4 text-sm text-justify opacity-70">
                As with many loans, your lender will need to check your credit
                score before granting the loan. This allows them greater
                assurance that you’ll be able to pay off the loan on time. Some
                lenders make a hard inquiry on your credit, which could briefly
                lower your credit score. Other lenders will only review or make
                a soft inquiry, which will not affect your credit score.

              What If Your Tax Refund Is Less Than Your Loan Amount?

                Because the tax refund loan is issued before the IRS actually
                processes your tax return, the money you get back may differ
                slightly from the amount of money you’re issued with your tax
                refund loan. This may happen if the IRS declines one of the
                deductions you claimed, or if there was some other
                miscalculation in your taxes. Your tax return might also be less
                if you have overdue child support, overdue tax debt, or student
                loan debt, or if you’re subject to a slew of other circumstances
                affecting your return. Whether your tax return is smaller,
                bigger, or the same amount as the loan you receive, you’ll
                usually still have to pay off the loan in full. Some lenders may
                make an exception and forgive the difference, but you’ll need to
                check with the specific lender in advance.
