              If you’re in a serious bind and you’re desperate for cash, you may
              be thinking about getting a payday loan. Before you submit a
              request, there are a few things that you should know.

                The average amount of a payday loan is $500. It’s not likely
                that you’ll find a payday loan for more than this amount, as it
                is a standardized cap in most states. If you’re in need of a
                larger loan to pay for a costly financial emergency, such as
                unexpected medical bills or automotive repairs, you may want to
                consider another loan product.

                Payday loans come with fees and interest rates that can add a
                lot more to the amount you will be required to pay back to the
                lender. The average cost of a payday loan is between $10 and $30
                for every $100 borrowed. So, for example, if you were borrowing
                $500 with a typical lender’s fee of $20, the total amount you
                could expect to repay could be between $570 and $670.{" "}

                The short loan term length is a defining characteristic of a
                payday loan. These short-term loans are usually required to be
                repaid within two to four weeks, usually around your next pay
                day. These small loans are intended to provide you with the
                money you need only until you receive your next paycheck.

                Because of the high interest rates and rigid repayment terms,
                many states enforce caps on fees, interest rates, and loan
                sizes. You’ll find that the conditions may vary depending on
                where you live, so it’s wise to do your research before
                submitting a request. Georgia currently prohibits payday loans
                altogether, while other states such as New York and New Jersey
                limit payday loan interest rates to 25-30%. More than half of
                the United States authorizes high-cost payday lending.
