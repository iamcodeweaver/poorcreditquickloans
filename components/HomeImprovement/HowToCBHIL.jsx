                A HELOC is a loan that uses your home as collateral and allows
                you to borrow up to the total amount of equity you currently
                have in your home. This is a popular option because you have a
                designated window of time to use it as a line of credit, adding
                to the total as needed. During that same time period, you can
                opt to pay only the accrued interest each month. The downsides
                are that the interest rate may change and even go up, and using
                your home as collateral can be risky if you are unable to make
                the payments.
