                to offer you a loan or market their loans to you. However, you

                limit all sharing.

                Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary
                of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a
                verifiable consumer request related to your personal
                information. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for
                access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
                verifiable consumer request must: (a) Provide sufficient
                information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the
                person about whom we collected personal information or an
                authorized representative and (b) Describe your request with
                sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request
                or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
                your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
                personal information relates to you. We will only use personal
                information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify
                the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. We do
                not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
                consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
                manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
                a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
                you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
