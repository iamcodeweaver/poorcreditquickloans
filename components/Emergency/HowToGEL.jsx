              We all hope we’ll never find ourselves in an emergency situation
              that requires money we don’t have on hand. Unfortunately, these
              incidents are quite common. Car repairs, medical bills, and
              unemployment sneak up on the best of us, and if we don’t have
              enough money in our savings accounts, we need to know what our
              options are. One way to handle unexpected expenses like these is
              with emergency loans.

              A payday loan is a loan that needs to be paid off when you receive
              your next paycheck. This type of loan can be useful if you know
              you will be able to pay it off right away without going further
              into debt.

              The length of a short-term loan varies, usually between 30 and 60
              days, giving you a little more time for repayment than a payday
              loan. You can still receive the funds quickly and the terms can be
              more favorable to help you pay off the loan quickly. This type of
              loan can be a great option if you know you will be receiving a
              bonus or tax return soon and can use that to pay it off. It is
              also great for emergency bills small enough for you to take a
              little out of a few consecutive paychecks to cover the cost.
