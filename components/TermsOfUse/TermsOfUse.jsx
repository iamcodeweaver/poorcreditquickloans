          <br />
          <b>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES </b>
          <br />
          You understand and agree that PersonalLoans.com is not a lender and is
          not the creditor for or issuer of the products featured on the Site.
          Any products or services advertised at this site or made available to

          <br />
          <b>LOAN REQUEST ACCEPTANCE POLICY </b>
          <br />
          Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does
          not signify any acceptance of your loan request, nor does it
          constitute confirmation of any offer to fund. PersonalLoans.com
          reserves the right at any time after receipt of your loan request to
          accept or decline your loan request for any reason. PersonalLoans.com
          may require additional verifications or information before accepting
          any loan request. PersonalLoans.com is not responsible for requests
          that cannot be funded or unsuccessful funding requests arising from an
          individual&#39;s ineligibility to qualify for the funding opportunity.
          <br />
          <b>CREDIT CHECK - FCRA COMPLIANCE </b>
          <br />
          By submitting your information to PersonalLoans.com you are providing
          your express written consent under the Fair Credit Reporting Act for
          selected lenders, lending partners, and affiliates with whom you are
          connected to obtain your consumer credit profile or other information
          from contracted Credit Bureau&#39;s associated with your inquiry.
          <br />
          <b>INCOME VERIFICATION </b>
          <br />
          Requesting a loan though PersonalLoans.com will require you to submit
          to PersonalLoans.com information about your personal income. This
          information will be passed on to the lenders or lending partners we
          work with in order to provide you with the proper loan. Some lenders
          or lending partners may require that you be able to verify your income
          before they offer you a loan. By submitting your income information to
          PersonalLoans.com you promise that it is completely accurate
          information. While PersonalLoans.com will not require any income
          verification, you agree that lenders and lending partners with whom
          PersonalLoans.com works may need to verify your stated income by
          requesting proof of income, such as copies of pay stubs or bank
          statements. You further agree that such a proof of income may be a
          necessary step in receiving a personal loan. You are not required to
          disclose alimony, child support or separate maintenance income on
          PersonalLoans.com.
          <br />

          By using the services available through the Site, you consent to
          receive electronically all disclosures, notices or other records that
          we, our lenders, or our third-party partners are required by law to
          disclose to you in writing regarding your loan request or the making
          of your loan (e.g., written disclosures required under the Truth in
          Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act) (the “Disclosures”).
          Each time you submit a loan request through PersonalLoans.com, you
          consent to the receipt of electronic Disclosures with respect to that
          specific loan request and the resulting loan, if any. Your consent
          does not apply to any future transactions between us, our lenders, or
          our third-party partners. Our lenders or third-party partners may ask
          you to agree an additional electronic consent agreement (or similar
          agreement). You are responsible for reading and understanding the
          terms of these additional consent agreements.
